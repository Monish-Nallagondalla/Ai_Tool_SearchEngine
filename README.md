# Conversational Search Chatbot with LangChain and Streamlit

This repository contains a conversational search chatbot built with Streamlit and LangChain, leveraging Groq's Llama3-8b-8192 model. The chatbot integrates external tools (Arxiv, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo) to answer user queries by searching the web and academic resources, with a chat interface that maintains conversation history.

## Overview
The project implements a web-based chatbot using Streamlit, powered by LangChain's agent framework and Groq's Llama3-8b-8192 model. It uses three tools—Arxiv for academic papers, Wikipedia for general knowledge, and DuckDuckGo for web searches—to provide accurate and concise answers. The chatbot maintains a conversation history in the Streamlit session state, enabling interactive and context-aware responses.

## Features
- Streamlit-based chat interface for user interaction.
- Integrates three search tools:
  - Arxiv: Retrieves summaries from academic papers (top 1 result, 200-character limit).
  - Wikipedia: Fetches concise information from Wikipedia (top 1 result, 200-character limit).
  - DuckDuckGo: Performs general web searches.
- Powered by Groq's Llama3-8b-8192 model for fast and accurate responses.
- Maintains chat history for seamless conversations.
- Supports streaming responses with real-time feedback via StreamlitCallbackHandler.
